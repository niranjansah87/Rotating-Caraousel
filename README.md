# Rotating Carousel

## Overview
This project is a dynamic and interactive rotating carousel built for showcasing content in a visually appealing, 3D-like rotation effect. It is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on smooth animations and a responsive user experience. The carousel can be used to display images, cards, or other content in a rotating format, ideal for portfolios, galleries, or product showcases.

## Features
- **3D Rotating Effect**: Smooth and visually engaging rotation animation for carousel items.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, including mobile and desktop devices.
- **Customizable**: Easily configurable to adjust the number of items, rotation speed, and styling.
- **Interactive Controls**: Includes navigation buttons or auto-rotation for user interaction.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for fast loading and performance.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the structure of the carousel.
- **CSS3**: For styling, animations, and 3D transformations.
- **JavaScript**: For handling rotation logic and user interactions.
- **Optional Libraries**: [Specify if any, e.g., GSAP for advanced animations, or none if vanilla JS is used].
